                Hi! My name is Bruce Bennet. Despite my name, I'm actually from Mexico, hehe. I'd love to relearn html as I loved programming with it!
                I love to apply my creativity. I love to design, draw, write, and make music. An important way I have applied my creativity is that
                I have made several card games, for a time I was making an animation (including its soundtrack), and written several scripts. 
                I hope that this course will help me make my own web page for my creations. I might use it to tell my story and share my works. 
                A web page can also help me show authority for my brand (as I remember it being an important factor when I studied digital marketing).
                I just need the money to get the rights to sell my works. 
            </p>
